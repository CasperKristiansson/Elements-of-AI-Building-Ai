# Elements of AI - Building AI

Building AI a flexible online course for anyone who wants to learn about the practical methods that make artificial intelligence a reality. You will get a solid introduction to for example machine learning and neural networks, and you will learn where and how AI methods are applied in real life. It is easy to move freely between the three difficulty levels, from multiple choice exercises to programming with Python – depending on whether you know programming or not. As a result of this course, you will be able to craft your own AI idea and present it to the community.
